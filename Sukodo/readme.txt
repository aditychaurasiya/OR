It sounds like you're referring to the Sudoku optimization problem. Sudoku is typically solved using logic, but it can also be framed as an optimization problem using techniques from operations research and computer science. Here are some approaches:
________________________________________
1. Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Approach
Sudoku can be modeled as a CSP, where:
	Variables: Each cell in the 9x9 grid.
	Domains: Numbers 1 through 9 for each cell.
	Constraints:
	Each row contains unique numbers 1-9.
	Each column contains unique numbers 1-9.
	Each 3x3 subgrid contains unique numbers 1-9.
Solution Methods:
	Backtracking Algorithm: Try values one by one, backtrack when a constraint is violated.
	Forward Checking & Constraint Propagation: Reduce possible values for cells as decisions are made.

2. Integer Programming (IP) Approach
Sudoku can also be modeled as an Integer Programming problem:
	Decision Variables:
	x_ijk={■(1&"if cell in row " i," column " j" contains number " k@0&"otherwise" )┤
	i,j,k∈{1,2,...,9}
	Objective Function:
	Since Sudoku is a feasibility problem (not an optimization), the objective is simply to find a feasible solution that satisfies all constraints.
	Constraints:
	Each cell has exactly one number:
∑_(k=1)^9▒x_ijk =1 ∀i,j
	Each number appears exactly once in each row:
∑_(j=1)^9▒x_ijk =1 ∀i,k
	Each number appears exactly once in each column:
∑_(i=1)^9▒x_ijk =1 ∀j,k
	Each number appears exactly once in each 3x3 block:
∑_(i=3a+1)^(3a+3)▒∑_(j=3b+1)^(3b+3)▒x_ijk =1 ∀k,a,b∈{0,1,2}
	Pre-filled cells constraint: For given cells, set x_ijk=1 for the pre-filled numbers.
	Solving: You can solve this using optimization solvers like CPLEX, Gurobi, or GLPK.

3. Heuristic & Metaheuristic Approaches
If you're interested in more flexible or faster methods:
	Genetic Algorithms: Use population-based search to evolve solutions over generations.
	Simulated Annealing: Start with a random solution and iteratively improve it, allowing occasional worse moves to escape local optima.
	Tabu Search: Explore the solution space while avoiding previously visited (tabu) solutions.
